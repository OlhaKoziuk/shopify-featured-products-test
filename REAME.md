# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (for compiling CSS)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or if you're using yarn:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

## Shopify Setup

1. **Login to Shopify CLI**
   ```sh
   shopify login --store test-featured-products
   ```

2. **Connect the theme**
   ```sh
   shopify theme dev
   ```
   This will start a live preview of your Shopify store with the current theme.

## Gulp Setup (CSS Compilation)

If your project uses Gulp to compile CSS, run:

```sh
npm run gulp
```
Or if you have Gulp installed globally:
```sh
gulp
```

## Development

- Make your changes and test them in the development environment.
- Use `shopify theme pull` to sync your local changes with Shopify.
- Use `shopify theme push` to upload your theme when ready.

## Running the Project
To start the project and see the store in action:

```sh
shopify theme dev
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure your Shopify store has theme customization permissions.
- Run `shopify logout` when you're done if using a shared computer.
